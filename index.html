  <h1>Debunking some XMPP myths</h1>
  <p>
    XMPP has come a long way in the last few years and is catching up with
    more recent commercial offerings. Some of the most common grievances against
    XMPP have been solved through extensions to the protocol called XEPs.
    Unfortunately, most clients do not support the most recent updates. Kaiwa
    implements them to offer you the same experience you got accustomed to
    using closed systems.

  <h1>Recommended non-web XMPP clients</h1>
  <p>
    Using our setup, you'll get a well-tuned and up-to-date Prosody instance
    implementing the latest XMPP specs. Not all clients have implemented
    them so we made a selection for you:
  </p>
  <ul class="clearfix">
    <li>
      <img src="/assets/img/conversations.png" alt="">
      <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.siacs.conversations&hl=en">Conversations for Android</a>
      <p>
        If you're an Android user, you're in luck! Conversations is a great
        Open Source client with support for many XMPP features, notably
        chat syncing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="/assets/img/monal.png" alt="">
      <a href="http://monal.im/">Monal for iOS</a>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the XMPP landscape on iOS is pretty bad. Monal is the
        only client still maintained and usable although it's still lacking.
        No support for chat syncing or message history. However, Monal is
        Open Source!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="/assets/img/pidgin.jpg" alt="">
      <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Pidgin for Linux &amp; Windows</a>
      <p>
        The venerable multi-protocol and multi-platform chat client is still
        the best out there when it comes to XMPP.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <img src="/assets/img/adium.png" alt="">
      <a href="https://adium.im/">Adium for Mac OS</a>
      <p>
        Built using the same core as Pidgin, it is its native Mac OS
        counterpart.
