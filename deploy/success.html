<h2>What to do next?</h2>
<h3>Configure your DNS</h3>
<p>
  You will need to add an A record to your DNS with the IP
  of the server.
</p>
<h3>Connect to Otalk</h3>
<p>
  Once your DNS configured, you can connect to Otalk by browsing to <em>yourdomain.com</em>
  using your username (without the domain) and password.
</p>
<h3>Add users</h3>
<p>
  Connect to Otalk using the 'admin' account and the administrator password
  you've provided to add user accounts in the LDAP directory.
</p>
<h3>Configure other clients</h3>
<p>
  Your XMPP server address will be your domain name and your username
  <em>username@yourdomain.com</em>.
